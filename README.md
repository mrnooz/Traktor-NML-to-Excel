_NooZ's script to export your Traktor collection into an Excel file

As the decent DJ I like to think I am, I often need to organize my tracks in all sorts of creative ways â€” to spot errors or manage my own very personal tags._


Install Python libraries: pip install pandas openpyxl

Place your Traktor collection file in C:/ and make sure it's named: COLLECTIONbig.nml

Run the script from terminal or your code editor: python traktor_nml_to_excel.py

The script will generate in the same directory as the script: Traktor_Collection.xlsx
